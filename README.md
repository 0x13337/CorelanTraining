1. Download `CorelanVMInstall.ps1` to your Windows 10 VM
2. Open an administrator command prompt and go to the folder that contains the `CorelanVMInstall.ps1` file
3. Verify/confirm that you have a working internet connection
4. run `powershell ./CorelanVMInstall.ps1`
5. If all goes well, the script will:
  - download Python 2.7.17, WinDBG, PyKD, mona.py and windbglib.py
  - install the required prerequisites
  - set up the PATH environment variable
  - create a system environment variable `_NT_SYMBOL_PATH`


FAQ 
----

## File CorelanVMInstall.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system

My freshly installed Windows 10 doesn't allow me to run your powershell script. It produces the following error message:

```
./CorelanVMInstall.ps1 : File CorelanVMInstall.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on
 this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
 ```

Solution:
* Open a PowerShell window (as administrator)
* Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` and press "Y" when prompted
* Try running the powershell script again.



##  !peb produces 'error 3 InitTypeRead' on Windows 10 1903/1909

On Windows 10 (1903/1909), WinDBG throws an error when running `!peb` or when trying to run mona.py commands:

```
0:000> !peb
PEB at xxxxxxxx
error 3 InitTypeRead
``` 

It looks like MS may have removed(?) type information from the latest symbol files associated with ntdll.dll.
As a workaround, you can try the following procedure:

1. Open folder `c:\symbols\wntdll.dll` and delete all subfolders
2. Open and administrator command prompt
3. Run `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x86\windbg.exe -o c:\windows\system32\calc.exe`
4. In WinDBG, run `!peb` and confirm that it is still broken
5. Close WinDBG and open folder `c:\symbols\wntdll.dll`.  There should be one subfolder, for instance `D85FCE08D56038E2C69B69F29E11B5EE1`(the actual name could be different). Open the folder and remove wntdll.pdb from that folder. We'll call this the `original` folder.  Leave this original `D85FCE08D56038E2C69B69F29E11B5EE1` folder open.
6. Download wntdllsymbolfix.zip file from this repository
7. Extract the zipfile directly into the `c:\symbols\wntdll.dll` folder. You should get an additional folder and a file:
- Folder: `6BFA8EAE64E07F11AD6B27F575C7BDC21`
- File: `chkmatch.exe`
8. From inside the new `6BFA8EAE64E07F11AD6B27F575C7BDC21` folder, copy wntdll.pdb and paste it into the other folder (the `original` folder, where you just removed wntdll.pdb)
3. Open an administrator command prompt and go to the `c:\symbols\wntdll.dll` folder
4. Run the following command to forcibly match ntdll.dll with the older symbol file (replace <foldername> with the name of the `original` folder):

```
ChkMatch.exe -m c:\Windows\SysWOW64\ntdll.dll c:\symbols\wntdll.pdb\<foldername>\wntdll.pdb
```



Example output:

```
C:\symbols\wntdll.pdb>ChkMatch.exe -m c:\Windows\SysWOW64\ntdll.dll c:\symbols\wntdll.pdb\D85FCE08D56038E2C69B69F29E11B5EE1\wntdll.pdb

5. Open WinDBG again (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x86\windbg.exe -o c:\windows\system32\calc.exe`), run `!peb` and verify that the issue has been resolved


Enjoy!
